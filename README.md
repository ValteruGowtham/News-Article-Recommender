News Article Recommender System - Project Description

Project Overview

The News Article Recommender System is designed to provide personalized article recommendations using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). By analyzing the content of articles, the system identifies similar articles and offers relevant suggestions to users. It leverages a combination of supervised learning for classification and unsupervised techniques for recommendation.

Objectives

Develop an efficient and scalable article recommender system.

Classify news articles into categories using machine learning models.

Provide personalized recommendations based on article content.

Improve user engagement by suggesting relevant news articles.

Methodology

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

The dataset consists of news articles with text content and their respective categories.

Missing values were removed to ensure clean data.

Articles were labeled using LabelEncoder to convert categories into numerical format.

Data was split into training and test sets using an 80-20 ratio for model validation.

2. Feature Extraction

TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency): Used to transform text data into a numerical representation by analyzing the importance of words in each article.

Limited to 5000 features to ensure computational efficiency while retaining essential information.

3. Model Development

Three machine learning models were applied for classification:

Multinomial Naive Bayes (NB): Effective for text classification with large datasets.

Logistic Regression: A robust and interpretable classifier.

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): A neural network to capture complex patterns in the data.

An Ensemble Model using VotingClassifier combined the predictions from these three models, employing soft voting for improved accuracy.

4. Model Evaluation

Performance was evaluated using Accuracy Score and Classification Report.

Accuracy reflects the overall effectiveness, while the classification report provides detailed insights into precision, recall, and F1-score for each category.

5. Recommendation System

A Content-Based Recommendation System was implemented using Cosine Similarity.

TF-IDF vectors were used to measure the similarity between articles.

Given an input article, the system recommends the top 5 most similar articles by comparing cosine similarity scores.

Results

The ensemble model demonstrated high accuracy in classifying articles into their respective categories.

The content-based recommendation system effectively suggested relevant articles, improving user experience.

Future Enhancements

Incorporate a hybrid recommendation system combining collaborative filtering with content-based recommendations.

Implement real-time updates for personalized recommendations.

Expand to multilingual support for broader applicability.

Conclusion

The News Article Recommender System successfully classifies articles and provides accurate recommendations using machine learning and NLP. This solution can be applied to news portals, content aggregation platforms, or personalized reading applications to enhance user engagement and satisfaction.
